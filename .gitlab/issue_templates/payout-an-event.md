# Account an SFS event

TODO:
- Put this in chronological order. Anything that must be done constantly or repeatedly, rather than once in the value-stream, should go in a special top-level section name 'daily' or 'weekly' or whatever and maybe doesn't need a check-box.
- Make the directions as simple as possible, so any future assistants will have an easier time following them.
