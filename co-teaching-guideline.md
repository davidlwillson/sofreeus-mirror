# Co-Teaching Guidelines

- Divide the labs.  Be clear about ownership over the teaching chunks.
- Limit interruptions and cross-talk.  When it's the other person's turn, don't offer corrections or commentary unless requested.
- Discuss in advance the approach you will use to manage a jr/sr pairing.
  - When will the jr teacher seek additional commentary from the sr teacher?
  - How will you mitigate an over-reliance on the sr teacher?
- Discuss a plan for MBWA (management by walking around) during the labs.
- Discuss a plan for presentations
  - Will you switch computers for each lab?
  - Use a single computer for the whole thing?
  - If you're switching, make sure you're up to date on the labs when it's your turn.
