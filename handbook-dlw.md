# About David L. Willson (DLW)

The general theme of this 'how to deal with so-and-so' doc is stolen from the manual for [Sid Sibrandij, CEO of GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/).

The purpose of this doc is to help folks know me and how best to get what they want or need from me.

I'm David L. Willson, and I'm writing the first version of this, but this should not be considered *my* document or my story about things. If you can think of any way to better describe me or how to deal with me, please feel as free to change this doc, as you would any of our other documents.


## Favorite Places

* Coffee: Nixon's, Englewood
* Lunch: Machete, Denver
* Dinner: Yak & Yeti, Arvada
* Beer: Locavore, Littleton
* Hiking: Round Mountain, Loveland
* Hacking: The Comfy Room, Littleton


## Flaws

I can't improve on these words from Sid: "Transparency and directness are part of our values and I want to live them by sharing the flaws I know I have. I'm fully responsible for improving the things below, listing them is no excuse. They are listed here for two reasons. The first one is so that people know it is not them but my fault. The second one is so I can improve, I hope that listing them lets people know I appreciate when people speak up about them."

* I do too much by consensus and get stuck in analysis paralysis. I want everyone to agree all the time and I want to *know*. It's OK to say, "We're not going to reach a consensus. Let's close discussion, disagree, and [commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit)." It's also OK to say, "David, you should be deciding about this, not asking others to decide for you."
* I can be clueless; sometimes subtlety is lost on me. It's OK to be completely direct with me. It's OK to tell me I'm wrong.
* I sometimes don't properly acknowledge other viewpoints. It's OK to say, "I don't feel heard. Would you state my position, as you understand it? I want to know I've been heard."
* I want what I want, and I can rush heedlessly to my desired result. It's OK to say, "Whoa!" It's OK to be the bearer of bad news. It's OK to be honest. And, it's better to surface conflicts and resolve them if possible, early, rather than letting the damage to team coherency damage our product delivery.
* I can get non-productively religious. I am strongly biased against political authority and proprietary software. It's OK to ask, "Are you letting what you're against be more important than what you're for?"
* I'm ridiculously absent-minded. It's OK to send me reminders by email or SMS, to assign me Issues with due-dates, to send me calendar invites, or in the worst case, to send Heather after me.


## Communication

For complex or conflict-laden communication, I strongly prefer 1:1 or 2:1, in-person or Zoom with video.

Almost any other time, [hit me in the DMs](https://mm.sofree.us/sfs-team/messages/@dlwillson), SMS text (720-333-LANS), or email (DLWillson@SoFree.Us).

If you want me to *do* something, assign me an Issue in GitLab, or send me an email. In either case, be as clear, direct, and terse as you can manage, and set a due-date, so the system can remind me.

I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-l-willson/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidLWillson), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/david.l.willson). Link/follow/friend me at your own risk.


## Making things

I love to co-work. When we can co-work in-person, let's do that.

When we *can't* co-work in person, we can work together over Zoom or Mattermost.

When that's not convenient, let's use GitLab.

## Three levels of performance

directly from [Sid's page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/#three-levels-of-performance)

There are three levels of performance:

1. Commitment: What we've promised to do.
2. Aspiration: We want to get to 70% of this, these are our OKRs.
3. Possibility: What could we do in the next year or three?
