What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is Internet cash. Bitcoin payments can be queued offline, but *must* be confirmed on the Internet. Bitcoin can be stored in a software wallet on your phone or computer, in a paper wallet, or "in the cloud" at Coinbase, Circle, BitStamp, BTC-E, or any of hundreds of business that would commonly be called banks but which prefer to be called "wallets", because regulations.

Bitcoin is like fiat, paper currency, in that it has no intrinsic value but can be traded for goods and services anywhere it is percieved to have value. It is like gold, silver, and other 'hard' currency, in that it is difficult to counterfeit, and not controlled by a central power, so the "base", the total amount of Bitcoin, cannot be expanded abitrarily. Like a unit of precious metal represents a bit of mining work, every bitcoin represents a past unit of computational work.

A software bitcoin wallet is very much like a debit card, except that the transactions are cash-like: direct from wallet to wallet, with no middle-man, irreversible, and neither the payer nor the payee needs to give up important information to the other.

Bitcoin is pseudonymous, NOT anonymous! Everything every wallet does is tracked in the blockchain. Depending on the regulatory BS in your area, online wallets like Coinbase may be required to connect your PII (personally indentifying information) to your online wallet.

If you already have a wallet, use it. 

DLW's recommendations, as of 2015-01-01:

    iPhone - No recommendation
    Android - Bitcoin Wallet
    All Desktops ( Linux/Windows/Mac ) - 
    For the workshop, use MultiBit, because it doesn't require downloading the blockchain
    For home, consider Bitcoin Core.

How to get more bitcoin

For the workshop, SFS will give you 7 mBTC to play with.

I like XBTeller (www.xbteller.com) for trading USD for Bitcoin and vice-versa.

Most online wallets will let you buy Bitcoin from a positive balance after a successful bank transfer or other payment completion.

What do you use it for?

Why prefer Bitcoin/crypto-currency over the usual?
---

 * Bitcoin is easy to transfer. Gold is hard to upload/download.
 * Bitcoin is hard to fake. Fiat is easy to fake.
 * Bitcoin payment processing is cheap or free. Credit cards are 3%!
 * Bitcoin is pseudonymous. Credit cards are personal.
 * Bitcoin is secure. With plastic, you give up your wallet every time.

---

---
