What's so cool about markdown?
====

Speed and compatibility are important, but switching back and forth is not a thing with markdown, after about 3 hours of using it. I memorized the several things that I need to do (headers, lists, horizontal lines, and word emphasis). I never look at the html-ized version until after I 'git push' my changes. Then, I make sure that git-whatever.tld hosting provider didn't completely tool my doc and I'm done.

The advantages of markdown:

    * You can edit it in whatever text editor you're using for your code.
    * Which means it's also highly usable at the CLI over ssh in vim/emacs.
    * And it's easy and natural to put docs close to code.
    * Because it's just text, it's diff-friendly, which is git-friendly.
    * Memorizing markdown conventions results in better notes everywhere.

But if the docs don't relate to code'ing or sysadmin'ing, almost none of that matters.
