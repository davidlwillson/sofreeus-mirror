Copying Media to a Digital Library (Ripping)
---

### CD

I didn't do it, but it's pretty easy.

grip is awesome for this in Linux
rhythmbox does a fine job
k3b
Kodi does it, too...
Basically, everything does this.

### DVD

I used handbrake.

It didn't work right the first time. I installed libdvdcss and libdvdcss2 from videolan.org and then it worked perfectly and easily.

### Blu-Ray

Jon and Heather ran out for drives, because nobody had one.

handbrake ought to do the job, but ... nothin'

It seems like I should start by installing and using MakeMKV. 


Using the Library at Home
---

Kodi seems best in class. I ran Kodi as OpenELEC on a Raspberry Pi 2.

It played everything I threw at it. MP3, OGG, FLAC, and a few movie formats.


Using the Library over the Internet
---

We never actually *did* anything, but we discussed and researched plex, subsonic, and MediaGoblin.

Is Plex free (libre) or proprietary? Hmm... It seems the answer is complex. Hah! Get it? Com-*Plex*? It seems like the short version is no. Plex itself is not free, but the things it is made of are mostly free. For a full answer, read the Internet yourself, young Jedi.

Subsonic, MediaGoblin, and Ultimate Media Server look interesting enough to try.

Dennis J. Perkins mentioned Calibre for managing books.

Garenthino Marcough, while 3d printing and advocating Plex, found time to show a book-scanning robot.
