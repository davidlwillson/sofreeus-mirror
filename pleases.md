Pleases:
--------

Life, and this event, are like a board game.

* Be a cool player. Enjoy the game and do what you can to improve others' experience.

* Take care of the game. Reduce, reuse, recycle, restore, rethink. We'll provide the cans. You use them.

* Maintain a beginner's mindset.

* Ask your neighbor first, then the TA, when you're stuck.

* Take turns.

  + Take turns with the expert and novice roles.
  + Keep control of your console; don't touch anyone else's console without their permission.
  + Be patient. We're all here to learn. The best learning happens through direct experience.
  + If you must touch another person's keyboard to solve a problem, revert your changes, and let them try it.

* Pass messages, but don't interrupt. Use [Mattermost](https://mm.sofree.us). Side audio might get you SMAC'd.

* Move around, but don't distract others. Remain clothed.

* Pay for the class. Almost every SFS class is PWYC (Pay What You Choose). You know what your budget is, what your values are, and your talents and time that may be worth more than your money. Whether you pay what was asked, or more, or less, or differently, is entirely up to you, your budget, your values and priorities. I trusted you before I met you.
