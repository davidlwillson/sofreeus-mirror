# The SFS Rap

To be read at the very beginning of every SFS event.

Welcome to the Software Freedom School, SFS.  Our purpose here is to teach one another why to choose and how to use Free Software.

## Define Free Software

What do we mean by "Free Software"? In the words of Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation: 

> “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.

## Why To Choose Free Software

If software is art or science and progress in it is important, then the preservation of creative freedom is important, and one ought to be sensibly biased toward software licensed by its creators in a way that respects and protects the creative freedom of the users, and complementarily biased *against* licenses that restrict users' freedom or worse, patents that restrict the creative freedom of everyone, including innocent bystanders.
