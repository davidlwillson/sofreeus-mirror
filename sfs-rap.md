# The SFS Rap

To be read at the very beginning of every SFS event.

Welcome to the Software Freedom School, SFS.  Our purpose here is to teach one another why to choose and how to use Free Software.

## Define Free Software

What do we mean by "Free Software"? In the words of Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation: 

> “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.

## Why To Choose Free Software

We suppose that software is art and science and progress in it is important. So, the preservation of creative freedom is important, and we are sensibly biased toward software licensed by its creators in a way that respects and protects the creative freedom of the users, and complementarily biased *against* licenses that restrict users' freedom or worse, broad patents and copyrights that restrict the creative freedom of everyone, including innocent bystanders.

## Moral Consistency

SFS benefits from Free Software individually and corporately. It is important to us to act like our benefactors; not like GitHub, Apple, and other companies that benefit from Free Software but do not "free" their software. Everything SFS makes or causes to be made is "free": our code is GPL and our other artistic works are CC BY SA.

## Pricing and Payments

When we say 'free', we mean free as in freedom, not [lunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch). We work hard to provide enjoyable learning experiences, and we expect to be rewarded. We accept cash, checks, crypto-currencies, and PayPal.  If you would like to pay later, you may ask for an invoice or take an Envelope of Karmic Justice.

Today's class price is ($32, $64, $128, or whatever). If you'd rather pay more, less, or differently, you may Pay What You Choose.
