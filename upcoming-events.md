# ONLINE: 2020-11-07 A Gentle Hands-on Introduction to Linux Containers using Docker with Alex Wise
 
Description:

Linux container runtimes, like Docker, can be incredibly useful, providing immutable builds of applications that run the same on any machine.

They are useful for people who write and operate software, as well as hobbyists and experimenters.

There's a lot of hype around Linux containers, come learn what they can (and can't) offer you.
