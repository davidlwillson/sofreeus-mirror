# UPCOMING CLASSES


## ONLINE Hacking Hours: Digital Independence Day

Let's look at this Humble Bundle: https://www.humblebundle.com/books/protect-your-stuff-apress-books

I (David) will probably buy a copy and we can explore it in-depth together. No, we won't pirate it. We're not the kind of pirates that violate the creator's consent.

As always, feel free to bring your own interesting problems and we'll hack on them too!
