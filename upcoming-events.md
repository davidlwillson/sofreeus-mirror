## Highlights

* Its a different world since I last write one of these updates. Pandemic, protests, an uncertain future. It's been difficult to know what to do or how to react.
* For now the best course of action we can think of is to just give to what we believe in: To that end, all proceeds from our upcoming Intro to DevOps class in July will go to [CODE2040](https://code2040-2020.funraise.org/) - sign-up link for the class is below
* To pay for the class, please sign up at below link first. You can then pay the normal way and we'll forward your payment to CODE2040. OR send a donation to CODE2040 directly for the suggested class price, include a comment along with your donation that says something like "SFS fundraiser" or "software freedom school", and send us a screen-shot of your donation (there's a "recent donors" tab on the donation page that will show a record of your donation). Send screenshot to captains@sofree.us (with something appropriate in the subject), we'll reply with confirmation of your slot in the class!
* Or you can pay us the normal ways directly and we'll send your donation on to CODE2040 after the class.
* At hacking hours recently we spent some time working on automating meetup API.
* We just wrapped an RHCSA study group led by David Willson and Mark Sallee. Mark has been an SFS member for a while now and this is his first foray into class hosting with us. Thanks Mark!
