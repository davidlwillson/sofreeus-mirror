# UPCOMING CLASSES


## ONLINE: Python Peer-led Study Group (8 week study group)

It's time to start consuming the snake! Python is one of the most popular and versatile (not to mention powerful) programming languages around. At least that's what you've heard, right? Well, it's time to find out for sure, and we're all going to do it together.

The Software Freedom School is hosting a Python Study Group. This will be a peer led event, meeting every Thursday night from 6:00-9:00pm, starting on September 10th, for 8 weeks. Due to current circumstances there will be no in-person option, so we will all be attending via web conferencing tools.

Who's teaching this you ask? We all are. This is a peer led event, and that means we're all here to help each other. We will be working out of the "Python Crash Course" book by Eric Matthes. Be sure to pick up a copy from Amazon, or where ever you like to get your geek reading materials.

The cost of attendance is PWYW (Pay What You Want) from $0-256. Just remember that there are infrastructure and hosting costs incurred by the Software Freedom School, so any contributions are much appreciated. Buying the book is your responsibility though.

## ONLINE: OpenStack: Free Software Clouds with David L. Willson

OpenStack clouds are much freer and maybe fluffier. Let's use them, instead of un-free clouds.

We will use an existing OpenStack cluster to provision a stack manually, and if time allows, by template, too.

We will manage Projects, Users, Instances, Elastic IP, and Security Groups, from the GUI, CLI, and if time allows, from a HEAT OpenStack Template.

Bring a machine with a web browser and a secure shell client.

David has been using and assisting others with Free Software like Linux for more than 20 years, and operating the Software Freedom School
(http://www.sofree.us/) since 2013.

This class is in development; your suggestions and feedback are
wanted! If thereâ€™s a particular feature of OpenStack that you would
like to see highlighted, please say so early, so we can try to plan
it in.
