## Highlights

* We got funding for scholarships for upcoming Intro To DevOps class! From Apex Systems Recruiting. Anyone who wants to take this but needs a little help to do it, take a look now [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiSI8keGto3fZv0HaQ5uydSqSlcLGLTMFnPQi8oLLW6DW6qg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.2103456709=2020-02-15+Intro+To+DevOps+w/Gitlab+and+K8s)

* We don't want to turn people away so we put our sponsorship money from good partners like Apex towards covering cost of the class rather than beer and pizza (nothing against beer and pizza)
