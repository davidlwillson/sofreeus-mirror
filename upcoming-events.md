# UPCOMING CLASSES


## ONLINE: Game Programming in Stencyl

This class is perfect for a kid-parent pair or teen or older. It's a great first foray into game programming, block programming, or just programming in general.

Stencyl is a block-programming system like Scratch, specifically for creating 2D games. In the class, we'll create a simple, space battle arcade game.
